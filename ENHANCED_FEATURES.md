# Enhanced Multi-Step Task Management

## Overview

The agent system has been enhanced to handle complex, multi-step tasks with intelligent continuation detection and user-friendly interaction patterns.

## Key Features

### 1. Automatic Task Detection
The system automatically identifies when a user request requires multiple steps:
- Creating applications/projects
- Setting up development environments
- Complex file operations
- Multi-component installations

### 2. Context Persistence
- **Conversation History**: Maintains full conversation context across interactions
- **Task State Tracking**: Tracks progress of multi-step tasks
- **Tool Usage Memory**: Remembers which tools were used and their results

### 3. Intelligent Continuation
When the agent detects that a task needs continuation, it:
- Analyzes the response for continuation indicators
- Pre-populates the input with "continue"
- Allows the user to simply press Enter to proceed
- Enables modification of the continuation prompt if needed

### 4. Enhanced User Experience
- **Pre-populated Input**: No need to type "continue" manually
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear messages when continuation is detected
- **Flexible Control**: Users can modify or override suggested continuations

## How It Works

### Task Detection
The system looks for keywords indicating complex tasks:
```
'create', 'build', 'setup', 'make', 'develop', 'implement', 'generate',
'react app', 'project', 'application', 'website', 'api', 'server',
'all files', 'complete', 'full', 'entire', 'whole'
```

### Continuation Detection
The agent analyzes responses for indicators that more work is needed:
```
'created folder', 'created directory', 'next step', 'continue',
'now i will', 'partially complete', 'still need', 'remaining',
'proceeding', 'moving on', 'setting up', 'configuring'
```

### Completion Detection
The system recognizes when tasks are complete:
```
'task complete', 'finished', 'done', 'ready to use',
'fully functional', 'all files created', 'project is complete',
'application is now ready', 'setup is complete'
```

## User Interaction Flow

1. **User Request**: Submit a complex task request
2. **Task Detection**: System identifies multi-step nature
3. **Step Execution**: Agent performs first step
4. **Continuation Check**: System analyzes if more steps needed
5. **Pre-populated Prompt**: If continuation needed, "continue" is pre-filled
6. **User Choice**: 
   - Press Enter to continue with suggested action
   - Modify the prompt for different action
   - Type new command entirely
7. **Repeat**: Process continues until task completion

## Example Workflow

```
User: "Create a React application in folder 'my-app'"

Agent: Creates folder, detects continuation needed
System: Pre-populates "continue"
User: [Presses Enter]

Agent: Sets up Vite project, detects continuation needed  
System: Pre-populates "continue"
User: [Presses Enter]

Agent: Creates components, detects continuation needed
System: Pre-populates "continue" 
User: [Presses Enter]

Agent: Completes setup, detects task finished
System: Returns to normal prompt
```

## Benefits

- **Reduced Friction**: No manual typing of "continue"
- **Maintained Control**: Users can override suggestions
- **Context Awareness**: Full conversation history preserved
- **Intelligent Automation**: Smart detection of when to continue vs. stop
- **Complete Solutions**: Tasks are completed fully, not abandoned mid-way

## Configuration

The enhanced system uses improved prompts and detection logic configured in:
- `interactions.ts`: Core continuation logic
- `default-configs.ts`: Enhanced system prompts
- `localagent.json`: Current configuration

## Technical Implementation

### Key Functions
- `isMultiStepTask()`: Detects complex tasks
- `shouldContinueTask()`: Analyzes need for continuation
- `buildConversationContext()`: Maintains context
- `processUserInput()`: Handles continuation flow

### Data Structures
- `ConversationMessage`: Tracks conversation history
- `TaskContext`: Manages multi-step task state

This enhancement transforms the agent from a single-shot tool into a persistent, context-aware assistant capable of completing complex development tasks from start to finish.
